The plugin adds the functionality to use mosparo in WordPress forms or forms from Contact Form 7, Everest Form, and other plugins.
	 
== Description ==
If you want to protect your forms in WordPress with mosparo, this plugin will help you with this task. After installing the plugin, you have to configure the connection to your mosparo installation and add the mosparo field to your form. The mosparo Integration plugin is compatible with the following plugins and forms:

- Contact Form 7
- Elementor Form
- Everest Forms
- Formidable
- Gravity Forms
- JetFormBuilder
- Memberpress Account Forms (login, lost password)
- Ninja Forms
- WPForms
- WooCommerce Account Forms (login, lost password, and registration)
- WordPress Account Forms (login, lost password, and registration) (also compatible with *Theme My Login*)
- WordPress Comments (and WooCommerce Reviews)

To use this plugin, you need an installation of mosparo so that the plugin can communicate with mosparo. Please find all information regarding mosparo on the website [mosparo.io](https://mosparo.io).

You can use different projects for the different modules. For example, this is useful for using mosparo for the account forms. There, you want to enable the lockout security setting in mosparo. However, this security setting may not be active for standard contact forms, so you must use two mosparo connections to two individual projects in mosparo.
	 
== Installation ==

= Automatic installation =

1. Go to the Plugins Menu in WordPress
2. Search for “mosparo Integration”
3. Click “Install”

= Manual download =

1. Download the plugin from the plugin site on wordpress.org
2. Extract the ZIP file
3. Upload the "mosparo-integration" folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory
4. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress

After installing and activating the plugin, please go to "Settings" > "mosparo Integration" and add a connection to your mosparo installation. See the Configuration section for more information.

= Configuration =

You can find all mosparo settings under "Settings" > "mosparo Integration" in the WordPress administration. Add at least one connection and enable the modules you want to use mosparo with. You can find all the information you need for the connection in the project settings in your mosparo project.

= Define the connection in `wp-config.php` =

If you want to define the mosparo connection in the WordPress configuration file (`wp-config.php`), follow the following steps:

1. Open the `wp-config.php` file in an editor.
2. Find the following line:
~~~php
/* That's all, stop editing! Happy publishing. */
~~~
3. Add the following lines **before** the found line. Replace the placeholders (for example, `<Project-UUID>`) with the connection settings provided by your mosparo project.
~~~php
define('WP_MOSPARO_HOST', '<URL-of-your-mosparo-installation>'); // Starting with https://
define('WP_MOSPARO_UUID', '<Project-UUID>');
define('WP_MOSPARO_PUBLIC_KEY', '<Project-Public-Key>');
define('WP_MOSPARO_PRIVATE_KEY', '<Project-Private-Key>');
define('WP_MOSPARO_VERIFY_SSL', true); // Should be true but if you do not have a valid certificate, change this to false
~~~
4. Open the WordPress Administration and go to the mosparo Integration settings.
5. Enable the modules you want to use.

It's possible to add only one connection in the `wp-config.php` file, which will be the default connection for all modules. You can add additional connections in the WordPress administration, which then overrides the connection from the `wp-config.php` file.

= Configure network-wide connection =

If you have a WordPress multisite network, you can enable the mosparo Integration plugin network-wide and configure the enabled modules and the available connections in the network settings.

Go to "Settings" > "mosparo Integration" in the network administration, add connections, and enable modules.

**Important:** A website can always add additional connections and enable additional modules.

= Default connection priority =

The origin of a connection will select the connection for a module:

1. The `wp-config.php` file connection is always the default connection.
2. _(Multisite only)_ If a connection is defined for a module in the network settings, the connection from the network settings will be used.
3. If a connection is defined for a module in the website settings, the connection from the website settings will be used.

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 1.11.0 =

**Formidable**
Because of an error when editing a form, we had to change the name of the mosparo field in Formidable. After upgrading to v1.11.0, you must add the mosparo field to your form again.

= 1.5 =

**Everest Forms**
Because of a missing event in the Everest Forms plugin, the invisible mode of mosparo can only work in the normal submission mode, not in the AJAX submission mode. We're waiting for an additional event in the Everest Forms plugin, which makes the mosparo plugin compatible again.
