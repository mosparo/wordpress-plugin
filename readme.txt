The plugin adds the functionality to your website to use mosparo in the WordPress comment and account forms (login, lost password, register) or a form from Contact Form 7, Everest Forms, Formidable, Gravity Forms, Ninja Forms, or WPForms.
	 
== Description ==
If you want to protect your forms in WordPress with mosparo, this plugin will help you with this task. The mosparo Integration plugin can add the mosparo box to the WordPress comment and account forms (login, lost password and register) or the forms from the plugins Contact Form 7, Everest Forms, Formidable, Gravity Forms, Ninja Forms, or WPForms.
	 
To use this plugin, you need an installation of mosparo so that the plugin can communicate with mosparo. Please find all information regarding mosparo on the website [mosparo.io](https://mosparo.io).

You can use different projects for the different modules. This is required, for example, if you want to use mosparo for the account forms. There you want to enable the lockout security setting in mosparo. But this security setting may not be active for standard contact forms, so you must use two mosparo connections to two individual projects in mosparo.
	 
== Installation ==
After installing the plugin, please go to Settings > mosparo Integration and add a connection to your mosparo installation. For this, you need the host, the UUID, the public, and the private key of the mosparo project. You can add multiple connections to use different connections for the different modules.
